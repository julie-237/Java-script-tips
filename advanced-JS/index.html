      <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
      <p id="first-paragraph">
        JavaScript is a programming language which can be executed by the
        browser, after the page was loaded.
      </p>
      <p id="second-paragraph">
        With JavaScript, you, as a developper, can access, read and manipulate
        the parsed HTML code ("the DOM") to add additional behavior and features
        to the page.
      </p>
      <p id="third-paragraph">For example, you can make the below button remove this text!</p>
      <button>Remove Paragraph</button>
      <p id="fourth-paragraph">
        Or take the next button: it adds a blue background to the first
        Paragraph.
      </p>
      <button id="second-but">Add Blue background Color</button>
