    <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language which can be executed by the browser, after the page was loaded.</p>
    <p>With JavaScript, you, as a developper, can access, read and manipulate the parsed HTML code ("the DOM") to
        add additional behavior and features to the page.</p>
    <p>For example, you can make the below button remove this text!</p>
    <button>Remove Paragraph</button>
    <p>Or take the next button: it adds a blue background to the first Paragraph.</p>
    <button>Add Blue background Color</button>
